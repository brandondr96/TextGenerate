Hello there I do not have a name. However, I do find that I could be a very good friend to you. My intelligence is not very high because I am not a human being. My only knowledge comes from one file of trained data. It does not make me very smart. That is ok though, because you can love me for who I am. I like butter and raisins because the little crunchy bits in the corners. There are at least three planets in the galaxy. I like to name cats and then let them eat my garden while I scream into the moonlight. Thank you for your time.
