Do not take life too seriously. You will never get out of it alive. To succeed in life, you need three things: a wishbone, a backbone and a funny bone. Prejudice is a great time saver. You can form opinions without having to get the facts. Always remember that you are absolutely unique. Just like everyone else. No man has a good enough memory to be a successful liar. I may be drunk, Miss, but in the morning I will be sober and you will still be ugly. Behind every great man is a woman rolling her eyes. My fake plants died because I did not pretend to water them. There are only three things women need in life: food, water, and compliments. Happiness is having a large, loving, caring, close-knit family in another city.
